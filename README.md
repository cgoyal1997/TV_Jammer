# TV_Jammer
This is my 3rd Semester Project on Analog Devices. Basically the TV remote emits a sequence of pulses when you press a button.The circuit  jammes that TV Signal when we apply external voltage.
Basically the TV remote emits a sequence of pulses when you press a
button. IR transmitter is fixed to the surface of the TV remote. This IR
transmitter emits the pulses in unique configuration for each button.
IR receiver which is arranged to TV will receive these sequence of
pulses that are transmitted by TV Remote and identifies which
button is pressed in TV remote. When we get 1.5 volt to 1.8 volt
maximum across IR LED in forward region and 5 volt maximum in
reverse region .it emits 38 KHz frequency . and incourrupt the singal
between remote and tv.
